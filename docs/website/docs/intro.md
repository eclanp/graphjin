## GraphQL

We fully support queries and mutations. For example the below GraphQL query would fetch two products that belong to the current user where the price is greater than 10.

### GraphQL Query

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    email
    picture: avatar
    full_name
    products(limit: 2, where: { price: { gt: 10 } }) {
      id
      name
      description
      price
    }
  }
}
```

#### JSON Result

```json
{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "email": "odilia@west.info",
        "picture": "https://robohash.org/simur.png?size=300x300",
        "full_name": "Edwin Orn",
        "products": [
          {
            "id": 16,
            "name": "Sierra Nevada Style Ale",
            "description": "Belgian Abbey, 92 IBU, 4.7%, 17.4Â°Blg",
            "price": 16.47
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::note Set User ID
In development mode you can use the `X-User-ID: 4` header to set a user id so you don't have to worries about cookies etc. This can be set using the _HTTP Headers_ tab at the bottom of the web UI.

### GraphQL Mutation

In another example the below GraphQL mutation would insert a product into the database. The first part of the below example is the variable data and the second half is the GraphQL mutation. For mutations data has to always ben passed as a variable.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "Art of Computer Programming",
    "description": "The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive monograph written by computer scientist Donald Knuth",
    "price": 30.5
  }
}
```

```graphql
mutation {
  product(insert: $data) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### Built-in GraphQL Editor

Quickly craft and test your queries with a full-featured GraphQL editor. Auto-complete and schema documentation is automatically available.
